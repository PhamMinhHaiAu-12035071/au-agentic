**Purpose:** How to debug the CLI and tests locally.  
**Read this when:** A failure is unclear from test output alone.  
**Do not use for:** Production incident response (use [../deployment/incident-response.md](../deployment/incident-response.md) when applicable).  
**Related:** [testing.md](testing.md), [workflow.md](workflow.md), [../../packages/cli/src/index.ts](../../packages/cli/src/index.ts)  
**Update when:** Debug entrypoints, logging, or test harnesses change.

# Debugging

**Status:** Currently not applicable — use `bun run dev`, single-file `bun test`, and source maps as needed.

**Trigger:** This file should be filled when:
- You add structured logging, trace flags, or debug subcommands
- Common failure modes deserve a documented playbook

## Toolchain troubleshooting

### Turbo cache giving stale results

Symptoms: code changed but Turbo reports `cache hit` and skips the task.

Fix:

```bash
rm -rf .turbo node_modules/.cache
bunx turbo run <task> --force
```

If the issue recurs, the task's `inputs` glob in `turbo.json` is missing a relevant file. Add it.

### Biome reports thousands of "errors" on first run

Likely cause: `biome.json` ignore globs do not yet exclude generated files (e.g., `.turbo/`, `coverage/`, `dist/`).

Fix: confirm `files.ignore` in `biome.json` lists the generated directories.

### secretlint blocking a legitimate change

If you are confident a flagged token is not a real secret, prefer fixing the source (rotate the token or replace with a placeholder). For docs showing example tokens, add an inline disable comment: `<!-- textlint-disable --> ... <!-- textlint-enable -->`, or add the specific file path to `.secretlintignore`.

Never add `--no-verify` to bypass. If the allowlist needs a new entry, commit it with the PR so reviewers see the rationale.

### `bun run perf` shows FAIL on secretlint

Secretlint runs through `bunx`, so it is installed in `node_modules`. If it is missing, run `bun run setup` to reinstall devDeps. Do NOT `brew install gitleaks` — the project has moved off gitleaks entirely (ADR-0007).

### ls-lint blocking a legitimate filename

If ls-lint flags a filename you believe is correct, the fix depends on the cause:

- **Typo / wrong case**: rename the file to match kebab-case (e.g. `MyDoc.md` → `my-doc.md`). Most cases.
- **External convention**: add the file or directory to `.ls-lint.yml`'s `ignore:` list with a one-line comment explaining why.
- **Per-directory rule is too strict**: update the regex in `.ls-lint.yml` (e.g. if a new ADR sub-format is introduced) rather than disabling the rule.

Never bypass with `--no-verify`. If ls-lint is genuinely wrong, fix the config and commit the fix with the PR.
